#### All of the above add-ons (if added) work initially when the plugin is loaded. You can also customize the add-ons available in your application using the instructions below.

>  Note: the Image add-on cannot be reconfigured by you personally, this is due to some problems with the work of this add-on. You just better leave it alone.
#
## 🤟🏻 Getting Started
```bash
yarn add strapi-plugin-react-editorjs
# or
npm install strapi-plugin-react-editorjs

For the plugin to work correctly, you need to give public and Authenticated role access to the plugin API, at the moment it is necessary for:
1. [Link Tool](https://github.com/editor-js/link)
2. [Image Tool](https://github.com/editor-js/image)
#
## 🛠 Need Help

1. [Image Tool](https://github.com/editor-js/image)

🚸 At the moment I do not have time to correctly implement the image loading module, you can see how it is implemented now and understand what the problem is. If you are ready to help me, then I am ready to explain and tell you what and how.
#
## 👨🏻‍🏭 In developing

1. [Personality Tool](https://github.com/editor-js/personality)
2. [Attaches Tool](https://github.com/editor-js/attaches)
